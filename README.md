There is also a possibility to run it directly from PHPStorm:

# What is the point of this?

One of the main reasons for having a codesniffer is to use the same code standard all over different projects. This streamlines the code and makes it easier for developers to find in the code but also gives you the feeling of that you know what to except. 

As an example you can always be sure that a variable should have a descriptive name instead of just one character:

Bad example: 
<pre>
$wsr = "Test";
</pre>

Good example: 
<pre>
$webServiceResult = 'Test'; 
</pre>

# Example
